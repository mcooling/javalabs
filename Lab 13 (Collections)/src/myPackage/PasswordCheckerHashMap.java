 * Make a copy of PasswordChecker programme from lab 4
 * Instead of storing the password as a String, store uname-pword pairs in a HashMap
 * Consider what data type the uname & pword should be
 * You will need to specify these using Java Generics.
 * Inside the while loop, ask the user to enter a uname and pword
 * If uname and pword match those in the hashmap, the while loop should exit & print a message
 * If not, the while loop should continue, with a suitable message to the user
 * Hint: What happens if you provide a uname that doesnâ€™t exist?
 * What about if you provide a uname, but an incorrect pword? 
 * Should you have different messages for each of these cases?
